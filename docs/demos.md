Two short clips of Spawnly running on a live cluster. Want to run them yourself?
Install the Claude Code plugin and run `/spawnly:up` then `/spawnly:demo` —
Claude brings the platform up and narrates the same scenarios on your own
machine.

## An agent, working end to end

A long-lived `weather-monitor` agent: a user chats with it from the dashboard,
it calls a `get_weather` tool, and its lifecycle events stream into the timeline
in real time. Under the hood the agent never touches identity plumbing — its
sidecar fetched a SPIFFE SVID at startup, exchanged it for a scoped token, and
the agent just does its job.

## Chained agents: spawn consent + real-time revocation

The headline features, in one flow. A `chain-worker` spawns a chain of
sub-agents, and you see two things that make agent delegation safe:

- **Human-in-the-loop spawn consent (CIBA).** A child can't obtain credentials
  until a human **approves the spawn** on the dashboard — using OpenID CIBA, the
  backchannel approval flow banks use for out-of-band payment authorisation.
  Once granted, the stored consent auto-approves identical repeats deeper in the
  chain.
- **Real-time revocation cascade.** Revoke one node and its **entire descendant
  subtree** loses authorisation within seconds — live, while its ancestors keep
  working. Pods stay up; their next protected call simply returns `403`.
  Reversible with **resume**.
